# Instructions  

Write a class named `Pet`, which should have the following data attributes:
- `__name` (for the name of a pet)
- `__animal_type` (for the type of animal that a pet is. Example values are ‘Dog’, ‘Cat’, and ‘Bird’)
- `__age` (for the pet’s age)

The Pet class should have an `__init__` method that creates these attributes. It should also have the following methods:
- `set_name`

This method assigns a value to the `__name` field.

- `set_animal_type`

This method assigns a value to the `__animal_type` field.

- `set_age`

This method assigns a value to the `__age` field.

- `get_name`

This method returns the value of the `__name` field.

- `get_animal_type`

This method returns the value of the `__animal_type` field.

- `get_age`

This method returns the value of the `__age` field.

Once you have written the class, write a program that creates an object of the class and prompts the user to enter the name, type, and age of his or her pet. This data should be stored as the object’s attributes. Use the object’s accessor methods to retrieve the pet’s name, type, and age and display this data on the screen.
